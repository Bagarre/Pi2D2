# Pi2D2

Pi2D2 is a Dynon D2 knockoff based on the Raspberry Pi..get it?
Its a basic javascript driven SVG using snap.svg and gets AHRS data from Stratux.

I'm currently buggy as hell and Im beating the poor Stratx 10 times a second. IE TONS of room for improvement.

Screen Resolution is 480x320 and intended for the 3.5" PiTFT hats.
 
Loading instructions to come soon.
